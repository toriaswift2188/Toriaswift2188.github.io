Hello There!

Thanks for stopping by! My name is Victoria Swift, and I am a Freelance Web Developer based in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Do you know what excites me more than being able to turn ideas into their own realities? It is being able to share those new realities with you! Thank you all for sharing your newly built realities, techniques. 

Happy coding!
